# SinkaDotCom
Small project while learning Java

This project is coded while my learn Java from the book "Head First Java". It might be similar to the code in this book. 
I'm not going to break anyone's copy right, but just an adivse: That is when anyone who want to use these pieces of code, 
please do anounce it's from that book. We should to honor the author's hard work. Thank you very much for the attentions.


These pieces of code of for a small game called "Sink a DotCom". User need to guess a number where the DotCom is, if it's
the right location, it "hit". If all DotCom "hit", then it "kill" which means get sunk. Otherwise, you "miss" the guess.
The location will be random on 7 x 7 grid. User should guess location like "a1", "g6" etc. 

If whoever be interested in this game, please don't hesitate to contact with me. I'm a junior learner of Java. May be we 
can work on it together to get it better. 

May you a good day.
